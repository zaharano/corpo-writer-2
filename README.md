# Corpo Writer 2.0

A second pass at building a tool to write the events for my text-adventure game engine. Coupling will be kind of tight with my specific game at first, but potentially over time I will make the core engine something more general purpose and reusable. I've read that focusing too hard on 'the engine' is a good way to get lost in the woods though, so my focus is not on that at the moment!
